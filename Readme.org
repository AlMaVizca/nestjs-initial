* Nestjs starter

This project is a code base to easily start new backend projects with:
- Basic configurations service
- OpenApi specifications (Swagger)
- Interface to handle the project (Makefile)
- A load balancer to use local domains and work on different projects

**   How to use it?
Clone the repository:

*Note*: As you will see, by default, the service will be deployed under the domain
backend.docker. This is because I'm using a [[https://github.com/AlMaVizca/dev-proxy][dev proxy]] to avoid port memorization.

*** start
 #+begin_src sh
   make start
 #+end_src
*** stop
 #+begin_src sh
   make stop
 #+end_src

*** test
 #+begin_src sh
   make test
 #+end_src

*** logs
follow logs
 #+begin_src sh
   make logs
 #+end_src

*** Extra notes
Take a look at the [[./Makefile][Makefile]], on some commands it is possible to specify the
service to perform an action
